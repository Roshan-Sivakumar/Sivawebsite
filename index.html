<p><b>   His Quote :   Practice, they say makes you perfect. </b></p>

<p><b></b>If you are in and out of a trade in a matter of minutes and making good money by doing it, your skills have to be razor sharp. <br>Sivakumar Jayachandran, a scalper has practiced thousands of trade before he became a successful trader.Successful traders are like race drivers. They know how to manoeuvre their way at high speeds. What makes them different is that they know what lies under the hood of the vehicle they are driving and how to correct it if there is a breakdown.The charts and indicators that they use are well-researched to the point where they become second nature and muscle memory. They do not need to think before they react; the reaction comes automatically.If you are a scalper who holds a position for a few seconds to a maximum of a few minutes, your reaction has to be automatic. There is no time to think, all the thinking has to be before and after market hours.<br><br>Sivakumar Jayachandran (@justsiva123) trades on the high-speed race track. <br><br> A scalper 90 percent of whose trades are held for less than two minutes, Siva as he is called by fellow traders was another trader who proved his mettle at the this year’s Investor Carnival held in Goa. Trading on expiry day along with veteran traders, Siva watched the market patiently since its opening and entered after 2:00 p.m. by buying Puts and making a killing because that’s when all his indicators are lined.<br><br>When I chose hotel management as my career path, trading was nowhere in my scheme of things. After my graduation from one of the top hotel management colleges, I was placed with the Radisson Taj Coromandel. Although the money was good, there were no family problems in life. Weekends and public holidays were mostly working. This was not how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. My father paid for my course, which I earned in a year and saved some amount even beyond that. I was having trouble keeping up with the hectic lifestyle and decided to leave the hotel industry without knowing what I did next.<br><br>Q: From Hotel Management to late shifts in BPO to trading options in the market, how did it all happen? <br><br>

A: Trading was nowhere in my scheme of things when I picked up Hotel Management as my career path. Post my graduation from one of the top hotel management colleges I was placed with Radisson Taj Coromandel. Though the money was good, life was extremely hectic with no family time. Weekends and public holidays were mostly working. This was not how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. My father had paid for my course, which I managed to earn in a year and also save some amount beyond that. I was having trouble adjusting to the hectic lifestyle and decided to quit the hotel industry without knowing what I would do next <br><br>

I decided to move to some other profession and approached a friend who was working for a Healthcare BPO and asked him if I can get a job in his company. He arranged for a meeting, but the manager there said that I was too qualified for the job and that my last salary and perks were too high for the level at which I would be working. They feared I would quit my job after learning from them <br><br>

When I walked out from that interview, there was another BPO next door. I asked my friend about it and he told me that it was run by a brother of the promoter of his company. I decided to give it a shot there, but again the same set of doubts were raised. I told the HR person there – Sugandh – to give me an opportunity. For some reason, he believed in me and allowed me to appear for the written test, group discussion and interviews, all of which I cleared. <br><br>
